 This Paypal IPN application is for testing and implementing IPN messaging
 on a Wordpress website.
 
 Apps in this repository will consist of on-going development and enhancments
 for the php development community.

 These Apps are stand-alone to be run on the front-end of Wordpress websites
 without the use of any plugins. Currently there is no Admin back-end for the
